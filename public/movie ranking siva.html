<hr />
<h3>1. ye zindagi nhi milegi dubara </h3>
watching this movie relaxes my mind so much and makes me realize that life is much bigger than what i think it is 
<h3>2.manjumal boys</h3>
i saw this movie just now and i was really mazed on how it was shot. and the fact that it is a true story just blows my mind away 
<h3>3.my hero acadmeia</h3>
i mean it isnt a movie but i just liked this anime , how he starts from nothing and has reached so far
